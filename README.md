# Machine Learning in Molecular Biology

All you need to know about mutational sigs. I used R in this course.

It is heavily focusing on mutational signatures and the main content include:
+ [Exploratory data analysis of mutation load and mutational signatures](https://qingliguo.github.io/MachineLearning_MolecularBiology-CourseWork/ML_A1.ipynb)
+ [Simulation and model selection](https://qingliguo.github.io/MachineLearning_MolecularBiology-CourseWork/ML_A2.ipynb)
+ [Patterns of aggregate mutational profiles](https://qingliguo.github.io/MachineLearning_MolecularBiology-CourseWork/ML_A3.ipynb)
+ [Mutation density over chromosome (kataegis) and mixture models](https://qingliguo.github.io/MachineLearning_MolecularBiology-CourseWork/ML_A4.ipynb)
